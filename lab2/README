Part 1:
1.1: Generating an otpauth:// URI
Given that the input secret is in hexadecimal format, we first convert it into numerical values. Since each hexadecimal digit occupies 4 bits and each uint8 digit requires 8 bits, we combine every two hexadecimal values (now represented in decimal form) to convert them into a single uint8 value.

1.2: Validating the Codes
First, we transform the input secret into 10-bit values, each represented as an unsigned 8-bit integer. Next, we apply the XOR operation to the key with both the inner padding and the outer padding to generate the inner and outer keys. We then obtain the current time to use as the message. This message, along with the inner and outer keys, is fed into the hash function in accordance with the HMAC protocol. The final OTP is computed by following the specific instructions outlined in the provided document.

Part 2:
The general flow for this code is after initial setup, the application will look for the authentication status within 2 minutes of time limit. Only proceed if status is active
Then the application will simulate a login prompt, if the username and password have been entered correctly, it will trigger the step_up request and wait for its responce. if the responce is success, login will sucess, otherwise fail

getAuthenticatorStatus:
Set the header and send a GET request to the designed URL. 
Extract the reply in json format, which include anthentication status and whether the user has enrolled with verification methods
Check whether the status is active and the user at least enrolled with one verification method

sendStepup:
After user status verified and corerct usrename and password verified
Set the header and the data which includes user_id, transaction_id (time) and a message (login_request) and send a POST request to the designed URL
Ectract the reply into json format
Record the reply's uuid as this will be needed in the next step

getStepupStatus:
Set the header and send a GET repuest to the URL constructed by the previous recorded uuid
Extract the reply into jason format
Check the "status" part as a trigger to constantly toggle the while loop for waiting
